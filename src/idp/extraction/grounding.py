"""Deterministic grounding post-processing for the agentic extraction loop.

The model reliably navigates to the *correct* region (its tool calls prove
that — see the ``reasoning_trace``) and reliably copies the region's *text*
into ``source_text``, but does not reliably carry the region's *page number*
through a long multi-turn conversation into the final ``submit_extraction``
call. Confirmed in practice on a 3-page BBVA loan form: a field whose
``source_text`` came verbatim from a page-2 region was submitted with
``page=0``.

Rather than keep tuning the prompt and hoping the model gets a mechanically
computable fact right every time, recompute ``page``/``bbox`` for every
``Extracted[T]`` leaf by matching it back against the parsed document's own
blocks — the same 'deterministic core, agentic reasoning shell' split used
elsewhere (arithmetic checks, DNI format): the LLM's job is deciding *what*
the value is; grounding it to a page/bbox is a lookup, not a judgment call,
and should never depend on the model narrating it correctly.

Two lookup strategies, tried in order:
1. **By region_id** (exact, preferred): if the model reported which
   region_id backed this field (``Extracted.region_id``) and that id
   resolves to a real block whose text is at least plausibly related to
   ``source_text``, use that block's page/bbox directly — no ambiguity.
   This is what resolves the case pure text-matching cannot: the *same*
   value legitimately printed on two different pages (e.g. a loan amount
   repeated as both 'requested' on page 1 and 'approved' on page 3) — only
   the region_id disambiguates which occurrence backed *this* field.
2. **By source_text** (fallback, best-effort): text-overlap search across
   all blocks, used when no region_id was reported, it doesn't resolve, or
   it points somewhere implausible (guards against a hallucinated id).
