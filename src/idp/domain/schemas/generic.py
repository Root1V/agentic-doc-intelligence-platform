"""Fallback schema for documents that failed classification (unknown type or
low classification confidence). No fixed field set is assumed — this is
precisely the case where there is no known 'where does field X live', so the
generic extractor does a single best-effort pass, not the bounded agentic
loop used by schema-driven extractors (see extraction/registry.py)."""
