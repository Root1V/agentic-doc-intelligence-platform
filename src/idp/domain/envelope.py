"""Citation envelope: the value object every extracted leaf field is wrapped in.

Grounding (page/bbox/source_text) is a first-class part of the schema, not a
bolt-on — every ``Extracted[T]`` field carries enough to answer "why was this
extracted as X" without a separate lookup. ``reasoning_trace`` additionally
records the bounded agentic extraction loop's tool calls when an extractor
used one (see ``idp.extraction.agentic``), giving "why did the agent look
here" for extractors whose method is not a single fixed prompt.
